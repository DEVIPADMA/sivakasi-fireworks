As discussed in the problem description, one room must contain at most 2 labours. But, these rules are not followed by fireworks industries. Inorder to save lives even when such accidents occur, the rules must be followed. So, to monitor the labour count in a room, a sensor must be attached to the door.The following algorithm when coded and applied to the sensor, the number of labours could be controlled.
Algorithm:
1.  Let us consider the working room as a stack.
2.  Since only 2 labourers are allowed in a room, let's say the size of the stack is two.
3.  Now, when 1 person moves into the room, one input is pushed into the stack.
4.  Similarly, when 1 person moves out of the room, one element pops out of the stack.
5.  So after 2 members entered the room, the stack became full. When a third member tries to enter, the sensor detects it and an alarm sound is heard.
6.  By this algorithm, the third person can enter the room only when one of the first two persons comes out of the room.
    	This algorithm is not only applicable for labour counting, but also for calculating the amount of  chemicals to be stored in a store house.
